In particular, deconvolution has uneven overlap when the kernel size (the output window size) is not divisible by the stride (the spacing between points on the top). While the network could, in principle, carefully learn weights to avoid this  — as we’ll discuss in more detail later — in practice neural networks struggle to avoid it completely. 





Stride 1 deconvolutions — which we often see as the last layer in successful models (eg. [2])  — are quite effective at dampening artifacts. They can remove artifacts of frequencies that divide their size, and reduce others artifacts of frequency less than their size. However, artifacts can still leak through, as seen in many recent models. 



In theory, our models could learn to carefully write to unevenly overlapping positions so that the output is evenly balanced.
