## Practical tips on applying gradient descent

Each of the above mentioned gradient descent algorithms have their strengths and weaknesses. I’ll just mention some quick tips which might help you choose the right algorithm.

- For rapid prototyping, use adaptive techniques like Adam/Adagrad. These help in getting quicker results with much less efforts. As here, you don’t require much hyper-parameter tuning.
- To get the best results, you should use vanilla gradient descent or momentum. gradient descent is slow to get the  desired results, but these results are mostly better than adaptive techniques.
- If your data is small and can be fit in a single iteration, you can use 2nd order techniques like l-BFGS. This is because 2nd order techniques are extremely fast and accurate, but are only feasible when data is small enough
- There also an emerging method (which I haven’t tried but looks promising) to use learned features to predict learning rates of gradient descent. Go through this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04474) for more details.
